Project name is a **ES6 Modules in Browser** that allows you to do use ES6 `import/export` capabilities without transpiling.

ES6 Modules support is landed in browsers,
Chrome needs an activation of an experiment flag, afterwards it is supported as well.

I created this repo in case of I want to try something and I don't want to spend time 
asset pipelining and transpiling.
